                              By the end of the tenth level, I had fallen in love with <span class="font-italic">Baba Is You</span>. It's a quirky little game that pretends to be a tile-based block puzzler. In truth, it's more meta than that, and it ends up being about breaking rules, thinking outside the box, and programming unlikely solutions to problems. <span class="font-italic">Baba Is You</span> was developed by Finnish indie dev Hempuli, and is available to play on PC and Nintendo Switch.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                              You play as a four-legged creature called Baba. <span class="retro text-uppercase">Baba Is You</span>.<br>
                              You want to reach the flagpole. <span class="retro text-uppercase">Flag Is Win</span>.<br>
                              You can push rocks out of your way to get there. <span class="retro text-uppercase">Rock Is Push</span>.<br>
                              But, you can't walk through walls! <span class="retro text-uppercase">Wall Is Stop</span>.
                          </p>
                      </div>
                  </div>

                              These various three-word sentences form the rules for the level that you're playing, but the words themselves are part of the puzzle as well! By pushing individual words around, you can form new sentences, changing the rules of the game. This is the revelation of <span class="font-italic">Baba Is You</span>. Oh - Baba can't get to the flag? It doesn't matter; let's change the rules so that <span class="retro text-uppercase">Rock Is You</span> instead! What now - there's no flagpole? So, maybe we'll change the rules so that <span class="retro text-uppercase">Wall Is Win</span>. And so on, and so forth. The further you go, the more nouns and verbs you learn, and the crazier the puzzles get! Usually, a level will put some immutable rules into a corner, so that they can't be pushed around, and then any words that are in an open space are fair game to be manipulated to form new rules.

                              The core gameplay is brilliant. And the game itself is charming. Its level design is superb. When it's not subverting your expectations, it's building you up and making you feel smart instead, by signposting the trick so that you don't fall into the trap. Early on, you reach a level where the rule <span class="retro text-uppercase">Baba Is You</span> is right next to where you start, which implores you to push those words around. So you do. But! If you push any word out of that sentence, <span class="retro text-uppercase">Baba</span>... is no longer <span class="retro text-uppercase">You</span>. What does that mean? Well. You lose control of Baba. The simple and endearing background music abruptly cuts out in favour of a lifeless drone. Baba remains, motionless, no longer <span class="retro text-uppercase">You</span>. What have you done!? After a couple of seconds, like a comedic beat, the command inputs for "undo" and "restart level" pop up. And of course, just like that, you are no more, so those are indeed the only two options left open! It's an existential crisis that simply fell out of the rules of the level - and it made me laugh out loud. This quirky sense of humour permeates the entire game. When you finally arrive at a particularly evasive solution, it feels like an inside joke between you and the level designer. And that's how <span class="font-italic">Baba Is You</span> gets you hooked! That last one was so clever! You have to play one more level...
